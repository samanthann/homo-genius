                                                Hello fans,
                                                I’m glad that you have chosen to visit the website. As we are in our early days of crafting 
                                                and establishing where as musicians want to head towards. We both know that we want to spread 
                                                culture and history of music, but at the same time want to heads towards the future of music
                                                 also. We decided to not only work with our own music and collaborate with each other, but 
                                                 hopefully with other artists out there too. We hope to provide some sort of mission statement 
                                                 and idea for our group of fans that has been so loyal to us ever since you have listened to our 
                                                 music. <a href="#"><i>Read more...</i></a>

                                                Hello Geniuses,
                                                As both members of the Homo-Geniuses, we decided to call our fans the Geniuses. We think it is 
                                                relatively funny and interesting thought. We have an upcoming concert in Boston! We are hoping that 
                                                you as a fan will show up. As we both come the Berklee College of Music and would like to show you 
                                                what we think music is. This concert we will tackle contemporary music such as indie and electronic
                                                 music. I believe that you’ll love what we have produce and will have a collab artist with as us she 
                                                 is our friend in our college years also. You Geniuses are what drive us to push the boundaries of 
                                                 music for us. We all come from humble beginnings and let’s begin our adventure!

                                                    Thank you for the turn out. We as Homo-Geniuses thank you for such a beautiful turn out. We were not expecting such a crowd! We want to introduce ourselves even more.
                                                    
                                                    We met up in Berklee College in our undergrad years. Adam, younger one, a prodigy in the symphony arts, is dedicated to blend and mix music from different cultures ranging on 
                                                    the early era of music to modern day symphony music. Sam, older one, who is dedicated in the arts of creating electronic and lyric for his music. We became friends pretty quick when we 
                                                    forgot to choose our roommates when we signed up for dorm and got paired up. Overall, we loved all kinds of music and wanted to try to blend both of our arts together to allow. Adam 
                                                    now teaches at Boston University under their music program and I, Sam, decided to continue education and explore animation for fun at MassArt.
                                                    
                                                    Our guest artist/friend was Michelle. She also went to Berklee with us. We met with her in class and got to know her more when we saw each other at a concert. We are glad that you 
                                                    gave her a warm welcome yesterday. It means a lot that you welcomed her. She is trying to pursue some sort of career in singing, you could find her on social media.
                                                    
                                                    We want to let you Geniuses know that you are what drives us to continue to create our new music and not to be burned out from working hard.
